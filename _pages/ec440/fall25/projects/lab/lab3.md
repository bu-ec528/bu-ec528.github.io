# Lab3a: Demand Paging


**By now you should have some familiarity with the inner workings of Pintos.**

**Test programs from project 2 should also work with project 3.** You should take care to fix any bugs in your project 2 submission before you start work on project 3, because those bugs will most likely cause the same problems in project 3.

**You will continue to handle Pintos disks and file systems** **the same way you did in the previous assignment** (see section [Using the File System](./lab2_background.md#2-using-the-file-system)).

**Here are the sections in this chapter:**
